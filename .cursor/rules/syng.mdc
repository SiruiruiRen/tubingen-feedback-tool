# Development Workflow: TÃ¼bingen Teacher Feedback Tool

This guide outlines the steps to modify the application, update your GitHub repository, and deploy changes to Render.

## 1. Making Local Changes

*   **Edit Files:** Make your desired code changes in your local project directory (`/Users/sirui/Desktop/tubigen/`).
    *   Common files you might edit:
        *   `index.html` (for UI structure)
        *   `app.js` (for frontend logic, API calls, prompts)
        *   `styles.css` (for UI appearance)
        *   `cors-proxy.js` (for backend proxy logic - less frequent)
        *   `render.yaml` (for Render service configuration - less frequent)
        *   `README.md` (for project documentation)
*   **Test Locally (If Applicable):** If you have a local development server setup (e.g., using `npm run dev` if configured in `package.json`), test your changes to ensure they work as expected.

## 2. Committing Changes to Git

Once you're satisfied with your local changes:

*   **Stage Changes:**
    *   Open your terminal in the project directory (`/Users/sirui/Desktop/tubigen/`).
    *   Add the files you've changed to the staging area.
        *   To add specific files: `git add file1.js file2.html`
        *   To add all changed files (tracked by Git): `git add .`
    *   *Example:* `git add app.js index.html styles.css`

*   **Commit Changes:**
    *   Create a commit with a clear, descriptive message explaining what you changed.
    *   Command: `git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"`
    *   *Example:* `git commit -m "Fix login bug and update user profile page"`

## 3. Pushing Changes to GitHub

*   **Push Commits:**
    *   Push your local commits from your current working branch (e.g., `clean-branch` or `main`) to the `main` branch on your GitHub repository.
    *   Command: `git push origin <your-local-branch-name>:main`
    *   *If your local branch is already `main` and tracking `origin/main`:* `git push origin main` or simply `git push`
    *   *Example (if your local branch is `clean-branch`):* `git push origin clean-branch:main`

    *   **Troubleshooting Pushes:**
        *   **Rejected (fetch first / divergent branches):** If the push is rejected because the remote `main` branch has changes you don't have locally:
            1.  Pull the remote changes: `git pull origin main --no-rebase` (This merges remote changes. If you used `--rebase` before and are comfortable, you can use that, but `--no-rebase` is often simpler if unsure).
            2.  Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur (Git will guide you; edit the conflicted files, then `git add <resolved-file>` and `git commit`).
            3.  Try pushing again: `git push origin <your-local-branch-name>:main`
        *   **Secret Scanning Violation:** If GitHub blocks the push due to secrets:
            1.  **Best:** Remove the secret from your Git history (advanced).
 
## Important Notes:

*   **API Keys & Environment Variables on Render:** If you need to change sensitive information like your `OPENAI_API_KEY`:
    *   Update it directly in the "Environment" section of your `tubingen-feedback-cors-proxy` service on Render.
    *   **Do not commit API keys directly into your code or `render.yaml`** (except for the `sync: false` placeholder if needed, but the actual key value should be in Render's secure environment variables).
*   **`render.yaml` Changes:** If you modify `render.yaml` (e.g., to change build commands, add services, or manage non-sensitive environment variables), committing and pushing this file will trigger Render to update its service configurations.
*   **Branching Strategy (Optional but Recommended):** For larger changes, consider working on a separate feature branch locally (`git checkout -b new-feature-branch`), making your commits there, and then merging that branch into your local `main` (or `clean-branch`) before pushing to `origin main`. This keeps your `main` branch cleaner.
