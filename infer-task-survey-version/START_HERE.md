# 🎉 Welcome to INFER - Simplified Version

## ✅ Your New Folder is Ready!

I've created a **complete, standalone version** of your INFER website in:
```
/Users/sirui/Desktop/tubigen/infer-simple/
```

## 📦 What's Inside (8 Files)

### Core Application Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **index.html** | Main webpage - open this to use the app |
| **app.js** | All functionality - same prompts & API as research version |
| **styles.css** | Styling - copied from your current site |

### Documentation Files
| File | What It Explains |
|------|------------------|
| **START_HERE.md** | This file - quick overview |
| **QUICK_START.txt** | Visual guide for getting started |
| **README.md** | Detailed technical documentation |
| **DEPLOYMENT.md** | How to host online (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.) |

### Assets
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **University-of-Tubingen-01.png** | University logo |
| **UNC_logo.avif** | UNC logo |

## 🚀 Try It Right Now (30 seconds)

### Option 1: Open Locally
```bash
cd /Users/sirui/Desktop/tubigen/infer-simple
open index.html
```

### Option 2: Double-click
Just double-click `index.html` in Finder!

## 🎯 What's Different?

### Study Flow

```
Task 1 → Survey 1 → Task 2 → Survey 2 → Complete
  0%       25%        50%       75%       100%
```

### ❌ Removed (Simplified)
- Welcome/consent pages
- Participant information forms  
- Pre-study survey
- Final survey (SUS)
- Database logging (no Supabase)

### ✅ Kept (Same Quality + Important Surveys)
- **Task 1 & Task 2** - Full feedback generation
- **Survey 1 & Survey 2** - Post-task surveys (Qualtrics)
- **Same AI feedback generation**
- **Same prompts** (academic & user-friendly)
- **Same analysis logic** (Description, Explanation, Prediction)
- **Same LLM** (GPT-4o via your CORS proxy)
- **Same languages** (English & German)
- **Same feedback quality**

## 🌐 Host It Online (Choose Any)

### GitHub Pages (Recommended - Free)
1. Create a repo or use existing
2. Push the `infer-simple` folder
3. Enable GitHub Pages
4. Get URL: `yourusername.github.io/repo-name`

👉 **See DEPLOYMENT.md for step-by-step instructions**

### Netlify (Fastest - Free)
1. Go to netlify.com
2. Drag & drop the `infer-simple` folder
3. Done! Instant URL

### Vercel (Professional - Free)
```bash
npm install -g vercel
cd /Users/sirui/Desktop/tubigen/infer-simple
vercel --prod
```

## 🔍 How It Works

```
User opens page
    ↓
Enters name, video, reflection
    ↓
Clicks "Generate Feedback"
    ↓
Chooses Extended or Short style
    ↓
[Analyzing reflection...] 
  - Creates sentence windows
  - Classifies each window
  - Calculates percentages
    ↓
[Generating feedback...]
  - Calls OpenAI via CORS proxy
  - Uses same prompts as research version
  - Formats output
    ↓
Displays feedback
    ↓
User can revise and regenerate
```

## 💡 Use Cases

Perfect for:
- **Quick Demos** - Show the tool without consent overhead
- **Workshops** - Focus on feedback, not surveys
- **Personal Use** - Teachers reflecting on their own teaching
- **Non-Research** - Using outside of study context
- **Testing** - Quick testing of prompts and logic

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### No Configuration Needed!
The app automatically detects the environment:
- **Production:** Uses your Render proxy
- **Local:** Uses localhost:3000 (if you run cors-proxy.js)

### Same API Endpoint
```javascript
Production: https://tubingen-feedback-cors-proxy.onrender.com
Local:      http://localhost:3000
```

### Browser Compatibility
✅ Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari
✅ Desktop & Mobile
✅ No plugins or extensions needed

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **CORS Proxy Must Be Running**
   - Your Render proxy is already deployed
   - First request may take 30 seconds (Render wake-up)
   - Subsequent requests are fast

2. **No Data Logging**
   - All processing happens in the browser
   - Nothing is saved to a database
   - Completely private

3. **Same Quality Feedback**
   - Uses identical prompts
   - Same analysis algorithm
   - Same LLM model (GPT-4o)
   - Same educational theories

## 📚 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ☐ Open `index.html` and test it
2. ☐ Try both Extended and Short feedback
3. ☐ Test English and German languages

### Soon
1. ☐ Read `README.md` for details
2. ☐ Deploy to a hosting platform (optional)
3. ☐ Share with colleagues or students

### Later
