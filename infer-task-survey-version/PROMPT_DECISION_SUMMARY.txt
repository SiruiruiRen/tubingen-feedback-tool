📊 KEY FINDINGS FROM HUMAN CODING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Inter-Coder Reliability (Cohen's Kappa):

Component          Kappa      Interpretation
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Description        0.63-0.75  SUBSTANTIAL - Humans mostly agree ✓
Explanation        0.36-0.48  FAIR - Major disagreements ⚠️
Prediction         0.51       MODERATE - Some disagreements
Others             0.16       POOR - Cannot agree on what's not PV

🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE: Explanation has LOWEST reliability!


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️  CURRENT PROMPT PROBLEMS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Problem 1: TOO INCLUSIVE for Explanation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Current instruction: "Be INCLUSIVE - accept common-sense reasoning"
Result: MASSIVE overestimation of Explanation scores

Example:
Text: "Repetition helps students remember better"
Current AI: Explanation (1) ← TOO LOOSE
Human coders: Description or Others ← NO THEORY CITED


Problem 2: Cannot Identify "Others" Content
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Human data: 89.1% of content is "Others" (not PV)
AI prompts: Often classify as 0-10% Others
Result: 60-100% PV overestimation!

Example:
Text: "The classroom has 25 students and is well-lit"
Current AI: Description (1) ← WRONG
Should be: Others (0) ← Not teaching/learning event


Problem 3: Explanation Definition Too Vague
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Current: "Connect to educational knowledge"
Issue: What counts as "educational knowledge"?
  → Common sense? ✓ (too loose)
  → Theory names? ? (unclear)
  → Research citation? ? (unclear)


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 RECOMMENDATION: USE STRICTER PROMPTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Priority 1: EXPLANATION (Highest Impact)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Change: Remove "Be INCLUSIVE"
Add: "Require EXPLICIT theory mention"

BEFORE (Current - Too Loose):
✓ "Open questions give students room to think" → Explanation
✓ "Repetition helps memory" → Explanation
✓ "Hands-on activities increase engagement" → Explanation

AFTER (Stricter - Theory Required):
✗ "Open questions give students room to think" → Others (no theory)
✓ "Open questions activate prior knowledge per constructivism" → Explanation
✗ "Repetition helps memory" → Others (no theory)
✓ "Repetition aids memory per spacing effect research" → Explanation


Priority 2: DESCRIPTION (Medium Impact)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Change: Add explicit exclusions for:
  - Demographics ("25 students", "experienced teacher")
  - Physical setup ("desks in rows", "well-lit")
  - Materials alone ("worksheets available")

BEFORE:
✓ "The classroom has 25 students" → Description
✓ "Worksheets are on the desks" → Description

AFTER:
✗ "The classroom has 25 students" → Others
✗ "Worksheets are on the desks" → Others
✓ "Teacher distributes worksheets to students" → Description


Priority 3: PREDICTION (Lower Impact)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Change: Emphasize theory requirement

BEFORE:
✓ "This will likely increase motivation" → Prediction

AFTER:
✗ "This will likely increase motivation" → Others (no theory)
✓ "This could increase motivation per SDT" → Prediction

📈 EXPECTED OUTCOMES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

With STRICTER Prompts:

Positive Effects:
✅ Better alignment with expert human coding
✅ Reduces 60-100% PV overestimation to ~10-20%
✅ More accurate "Others" detection
✅ Pushes students to learn theory names
✅ Higher research validity
✅ Better discriminates expertise levels

Negative Effects:
⚠️  Lower PV scores overall (may discourage students)
⚠️  Requires students to know theory terminology
⚠️  May penalize implicit understanding
⚠️  Less encouraging for beginners
⚠️  Could reduce engagement if too critical


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 DECISION MATRIX
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Use STRICTER Prompts if:
✓ Research validity is priority
✓ You want alignment with expert coding
✓ Students are advanced (know theory)
✓ Goal: Summative assessment
✓ Need accurate PV measurements

Use CURRENT (Loose) Prompts if:
✓ Formative support is priority
✓ Students are beginners (learning theory)
✓ Goal: Encourage reflection
✓ Accept some overestimation for motivation
✓ Focus on growth, not accuracy


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚀 RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 1: TEST Both Versions
─────────────────────────────
  → Create STRICT version of Explanation prompt
  → Run on 100 sample segments
  → Compare kappa with human R2
  → If κ > 0.60 → Continue to Step 2
  → If κ < 0.60 → Iterate on prompt wording

Step 2: PILOT with Small Student Group
─────────────────────────────
  → Test with 10-15 students
  → Collect feedback on:
     - Do scores feel fair?
     - Is feedback helpful?
     - Motivated to revise?
  → Compare revision patterns
  → Assess student satisfaction

Step 3: DECISION
─────────────────────────────
  → If students respond positively + good κ → Deploy STRICT
  → If students discouraged but good κ → Provide more scaffolding
  → If bad κ → Iterate on prompts
  → If good student response but bad κ → Keep CURRENT

Step 4: MONITOR
─────────────────────────────
  → Track PV score distributions
  → Watch for student complaints
  → Monitor revision rates
  → Adjust as needed

✅ BOTTOM LINE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

For RESEARCH STUDY:
→ Use STRICTER prompts (especially Explanation)
→ Better validity, worth the trade-off
→ Aligns with expert judgment
→ Pushes students to use theory

For FORMATIVE TOOL:
→ Keep CURRENT prompts
→ Prioritize encouragement
→ Accept some overestimation
→ Support learning process

YOUR CHOICE depends on: Research vs Formative priority 🎯
