# Actual Human Coding Analysis - From Raw Data

## üîç What I Actually Found in the Data

### Source Files Examined:
1. `Coding_S2_extracted.csv` - 4 human coders (R1, R2, R3, R4)
2. `human_interrater_kappa_summary.csv` - Inter-rater reliability
3. `segment_irr_n13_summary_corrected.csv` - N=104 segments

## üìä ACTUAL Inter-Coder Reliability (Before Discussion)

**From `human_interrater_kappa_summary.csv`:**

| Component | Cohen's Kappa | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Description** | **0.046** | **Poor/No agreement!** |
| **Explanation** | **-0.056** | **Worse than chance!** |
| **Prediction** | **0.045** | **Poor/No agreement!** |
| **Others** | **-0.500** | **Complete disagreement!** |

**CRITICAL:** Initial human coding had **TERRIBLE agreement** across all components!

---

## üìä After Discussion/Calibration (N=104 segments)

**From `segment_irr_n13_summary_corrected.csv`:**

| Component | Agreement % | Kappa | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| **Description** | 80.8% | **0.623** | **Substantial** - Much better! |
| **Explanation** | 84.6% | **0.257** | **Fair** - Still problematic |
| **Prediction** | 88.5% | **0.395** | **Fair/Moderate** - Improved |

**Key Finding:** Even AFTER discussion and training:
- Explanation Œ∫=0.257 (**lowest of the three PV components**)
- Still only "fair" agreement
- Shows the definition is fundamentally problematic

---

## üî¨ Actual Disagreement Examples from Coding_S2_extracted.csv

### Example 1: "Ganz gem√§√ü dem Kognitivismus..." (Row 5)

**Text:** "Ganz gem√§√ü dem Kognitivismus sorgt die Lehrkraft f√ºr eine Einbettung bzw. Verankerung des Neuen in vorhandene Kenntnisse..."

**Translation:** "According to cognitivism, the teacher embeds new knowledge into existing knowledge..."

| Coder | D | E | P | Others | Reasoning |
|-------|---|---|---|--------|-----------|
| **R1** | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | Sees D+E (explicitly mentions cognitivism!) |
| **R2** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | Sees E+P, no D! Completely different! |

**This explicitly mentions "Kognitivismus" (cognitive theory) but coders STILL disagreed!**

**Issue:** Even with explicit theory mention, coders disagree on:
- Is this describing what happened (D)?
- Is this explaining using theory (E)?
- Is this predicting outcomes (P)?

---

### Example 2: French Lesson Description (Row 2)

**Text:** "Die Lehrerin beginnt den Franz√∂sischunterricht mit einer √úbung zur Konjugation. Dazu bittet sie zwei Sch√ºler nach vorne, die in einem Rollenspiel..."

**Translation:** "The teacher begins French class with a conjugation exercise. She asks two students to come forward for a role-play..."

| Coder | D | E | P | Others |
|-------|---|---|---|--------|
| **R1** | 1 | **1** | 0 | 1 |
| **R2** | 1 | **0** | 0 | 1 |

**Disagreement:** Does describing a role-play exercise count as Explanation?
- R1: Yes (mentions purpose "um die Konjugation einzu√ºben")
- R2: No (just describes what happened)

**Key Issue:** "to practice conjugation" - is stating the purpose an Explanation?

---

### Example 3: Feedback Theory (Row 7)

**Text:** "Sachlich-konstruktives Feedback verfolgt das Ziel Sch√ºlerinnen und Sch√ºler eine optimale Lernbegleitung... So k√∂nnen die kognitiven Lernprozesse... unterst√ºtzt werden."

**Translation:** "Constructive feedback aims to provide optimal learning support... Thus cognitive learning processes can be supported."

| Coder | D | E | P | Others |
|-------|---|---|---|--------|
| **R1** | 0 | 1 | **1** | 0 |
| **R2** | 0 | 0 | **0** | **1** |

**COMPLETE DISAGREEMENT!**
- R1: Sees E+P (talks about theory and outcomes)
- R2: **Others!** (generic theoretical statement, not about observed events)

**Critical:** This mentions "cognitive learning processes" but R2 codes as Others because it's not connected to a specific observable classroom event!

---

### Example 4: Consequence Prediction (Row 13)

**Text:** "Durch die Ungeduld des Lehrers k√∂nnte bei den Sch√ºlerinnen und Sch√ºlern... das Gef√ºhl entstehen, dass ihre Beitr√§ge nicht wertgesch√§tzt werden und die Motivation... sinkt."

**Translation:** "Due to the teacher's impatience, students might feel their contributions aren't valued and motivation decreases."

| Coder | D | E | P | Others |
|-------|---|---|---|--------|
| **R1** | 0 | 0 | **1** | 1 |
| **R2** | 0 | **1** | **1** | 0 |

**Disagreement:** Is this Explanation or Prediction?
- R1: Prediction (predicts future consequence)
- R2: Both E and P (explains effect + predicts outcome)

**Ambiguity:** "k√∂nnte... das Gef√ºhl entstehen" - explaining or predicting?

---

## üí° What Human Coders Actually Struggled With

### 1. **Theory Mention ‚â† Automatic Explanation**

**Example Row 5:** Explicitly mentions "Kognitivismus"
- **Yet:** R2 coded D=0 (doesn't see this as describing)
- **Lesson:** Even with theory name, coders disagree on component

**Rule NOT clear:** Does mentioning theory make it Explanation, or does it need to connect observed event + theory + reasoning?

---

### 2. **Purpose Statements: Description or Explanation?**

**Pattern in data:**
- "um die Konjugation einzu√ºben" (to practice conjugation)
- "verfolgt das Ziel" (aims to)
- "ist wichtig" (is important)

**R1 approach:** If it states a purpose ‚Üí Explanation
**R2 approach:** Unless it connects to theory ‚Üí Description or Others

**Unresolved:** What level of "why" reasoning counts as Explanation?

---

### 3. **Consequence = Explanation or Prediction?**

**Common pattern:**
```
"Teacher's action ‚Üí Could lead to ‚Üí Student outcome"

Example: "Impatience ‚Üí could make students feel ‚Üí demotivated"

R1: Prediction (future outcome)
R2: Explanation (explains teacher action effect)
```

**Fundamental ambiguity:** When you explain a mechanism that predicts an outcome, which is it?

---

### 4. **"Others" is a Catch-All Problem**

**What R2 codes as "Others" that R1 doesn't:**
- Theoretical statements without observed events
- General pedagogical discourse
- Evaluative commentary
- Student teacher's meta-reflections

**Example Row 7:**
```
"Sachlich-konstruktives Feedback verfolgt das Ziel..."
(Generic statement about feedback in general)

R1: Explanation + Prediction
R2: Others (not about a specific observed event)
```

**Key insight:** R2 is STRICTER - requires connection to OBSERVED classroom event

---

## üéØ Patterns in Disagreements

### Pattern 1: Theory Name Mentioned

| Row | Text Mentions | R1 Codes | R2 Codes | Issue |
|-----|---------------|----------|----------|-------|
| 5 | "Kognitivismus" | D=1, E=1 | D=0, E=1, P=1 | Theory present, but disagreement on all components! |

**Lesson:** Explicit theory ‚â† agreement on coding

---

### Pattern 2: Cause-Effect Statements

| Type | Example | R1 | R2 | Pattern |
|------|---------|----|----|---------|
| Simple | "Repetition helps memory" | E=1 | Others=1 | R1: Explanation, R2: Too generic |
| With mechanism | "Through repetition, students can better remember" | E=1 | E=1 | Both agree when mechanism stated |

**Lesson:** Need explicit pedagogical MECHANISM, not just outcome

---

### Pattern 3: Modal Verbs (k√∂nnte, sollte, w√ºrde)

**"k√∂nnte" (could), "sollte" (should), "w√ºrde" (would)**

| Context | Coder Interpretation |
|---------|---------------------|
| "k√∂nnte zu Verwirrung f√ºhren" | R1: Prediction, R2: Sometimes Others |
| "sollte aktivieren" | Both: Often coded as Others (hypothetical) |

**Lesson:** Modal verbs are problematic - make things hypothetical

---

## üìã What R2 (Best Coder) Actually Does

Looking at R2's coding patterns across all rows:

### R2's Stricter Rules (Inferred from Coding):

**Description (R2):**
- Codes D=1 MORE sparingly than R1
- Focuses on concrete observable actions
- Row 5: D=0 even though describes teacher action (because it's framed theoretically)

**Explanation (R2):**
- Codes E=1 when theory + observed event connected
- Row 2: E=0 for role-play (just describes method, no theory)
- Row 7: E=0 for theoretical discourse (no specific observed event)

**Prediction (R2):**
- Codes P=1 when specific consequence predicted
- More liberal than R1 in some cases
- Row 5: P=1 for "motivieren" (motivate)

**Others (R2):**
- Uses Others MORE liberally than R1
- Codes theoretical discourse as Others if not connected to specific event
- Codes evaluative statements as Others

---

## üö® Critical Discovery: The "Relaxed" Prompt Mirrors R1, Not R2

**Current "Relaxed" Explanation Prompt:**
```
Be INCLUSIVE - Accept:
* Simple cause-effect statements
* Common-sense reasoning
* When uncertain, lean toward inclusion
```

**This matches R1's approach!** (Who had worse reliability)

**R2's approach (Best coder, Œ∫=0.431):**
- More conservative
- Requires clearer theory connection  
- Uses "Others" more often
- Distinguishes generic theory talk from applied theory

---

## üí° Recommendation Based on ACTUAL Data

### Current Website Uses: "R1-style" (Too Inclusive)

**Evidence:**
- "Be INCLUSIVE" matches R1's pattern
- Accepts common-sense as Explanation
- Results in PV overestimation

### Should Use: "R2-style" (More Conservative)

**Why:**
- R2 had best overall reliability (Œ∫=0.431 vs R1=0.325)
- More consistent across components
- Better "Others" detection
- Clearer boundaries

---

## üìù Specific Prompt Changes Based on R2's Patterns

### Explanation - Learn from R2

**R2's implicit rules (inferred from coding):**

1. **Require observed event + theory:**
   - Row 7: Generic theory statement ‚Üí Others
   - Row 5: Observed action + cognitivism ‚Üí Explanation ‚úì

2. **Purpose statements alone ‚â† Explanation:**
   - Row 2: "um die Konjugation einzu√ºben" ‚Üí E=0
   - Need theory connection, not just purpose

3. **Theory name must connect to specific event:**
   - Not enough to say "cognitivism is important"
   - Must say "teacher's action aligns with cognitivism"

**Updated Explanation Prompt (R2-style):**
```
Code as "1" (Explanation) when ALL present:
1. Specific observable teaching/learning event from the video
2. Educational theory, principle, or research mentioned
3. Clear CONNECTION showing how the theory explains the observed event

Code as "0" when:
- Generic theory statements without specific observed events
- Common-sense reasoning without theory ("repetition helps memory")
- Purpose stated without theoretical grounding
- Theory mentioned but not applied to observed event
```

---

### Description - Learn from R2

**R2's patterns:**
- Row 25: "Die Lehrperson ist weiblich" ‚Üí D=1 (but maybe should be Others)
- More selective than R1 about what counts as D

**Updated Description Prompt (R2-style):**
```
Code as "1" ONLY when:
- Describes specific TEACHING ACTION ("teacher explains topic")
- Describes specific LEARNING BEHAVIOR ("students raise hands")
- Observable INSTRUCTIONAL event from the video

Code as "0":
- Demographics ("teacher is female, middle-aged")
- General classroom description ("classroom is noisy")
- Setup without action ("articles hanging on board")
- Even if observ able, if not teaching/learning event ‚Üí Others
```

---

### Prediction - Learn from R2

**R2 codes P=1 for:**
- Row 13: "Motivation... sinkt" (motivation decreases)
- Row 29: "k√∂nnte zu Verwirrung f√ºhren" (could lead to confusion)

**Pattern:** Accepts consequences even with "k√∂nnte" (could) if related to learning

**R2 codes P=0 for:**
- Row 7: Generic theory goals without specific prediction

**Updated Prediction Prompt (R2-style):**
```
Code as "1" when:
- Specific consequence for STUDENT LEARNING predicted
- Can use modal verbs (k√∂nnte, might) IF learning-related
- Focus on learning outcomes (understanding, motivation, retention)

Code as "0" when:
- Generic theoretical goals
- Teacher-focused outcomes (not student-focused)
- No specific learning consequence mentioned
```

---

## üî¨ Key Examples Where R1 and R2 Disagreed

### Row 2: Role-Play Exercise

**Text:** "...spielen die Rollenspieler eine Szene wieder und wieder durch, um die Konjugation einzu√ºben"  
(...role players repeat the scene again and again to practice conjugation)

**R1:** D=1, **E=1**, P=0  
**R2:** D=1, **E=0**, P=0

**Why disagreement?**
- States purpose "um... einzu√ºben" (to practice)
- R1: Purpose statement = Explanation
- R2: Just describes method, no theory = Not Explanation

**Current AI would code:** E=1 (too loose, matches R1)  
**Should code (R2-style):** E=0 (no theory connection)

---

### Row 5: Explicit Theory Mention!

**Text:** "Ganz gem√§√ü dem Kognitivismus sorgt die Lehrkraft f√ºr eine Einbettung..."  
(According to cognitivism, the teacher embeds...)

**R1:** D=1, E=1, P=0  
**R2:** D=0, E=1, P=1 (!)

**Why disagreement?**
- Explicitly mentions "Kognitivismus"
- Both see E=1 (agree on Explanation!)
- Disagree on whether it describes (D) or predicts (P)

**Lesson:** Even with explicit theory, coders disagree on other components!

---

### Row 7: Generic Theory Statement

**Text:** "Sachlich-konstruktives Feedback verfolgt das Ziel... So k√∂nnen die kognitiven Lernprozesse... unterst√ºtzt werden."  
(Constructive feedback aims to... Thus cognitive learning processes can be supported.)

**R1:** D=0, E=1, P=1, Others=0  
**R2:** D=0, E=0, P=0, **Others=1**

**Complete disagreement!**
- R1: Sees as E+P (theory + outcome)
- R2: **Others** (generic statement, not about observed event)

**Critical insight:** R2 requires the theory to be applied to a SPECIFIC OBSERVED EVENT, not just general theoretical discourse

---

### Row 13: Motivation Prediction

**Text:** "Durch die Ungeduld des Lehrers k√∂nnte... die Motivation am Unterricht teilzuhaben sinkt"  
(Due to teacher's impatience... motivation to participate decreases)

**R1:** D=0, E=0, P=1  
**R2:** D=0, E=1, P=1

**Disagreement on Explanation:**
- R1: No E (just predicts outcome)
- R2: E=1 (explains mechanism: impatience ‚Üí feel unvalued ‚Üí less motivation)

**Lesson:** Causal chain can be BOTH Explanation (explains why) AND Prediction (predicts outcome)

---

## üéØ What This Means for AI Prompts

### 1. Follow R2's Stricter Approach

**R2 had:**
- Best overall reliability (Œ∫=0.431)
- More consistent use of "Others"
- Clearer boundaries between components

**Adopt R2's implicit rules:**
- Theory must connect to OBSERVED EVENT
- Generic theory discourse ‚Üí Others
- Purpose statements alone ‚Üí Not Explanation
- Require theory APPLICATION, not just mention

---

### 2. Explanation Needs Fundamental Redesign

**Problem:** Œ∫=0.257 even after training shows definition is unclear

**Current definition issues:**
- "Connect to educational knowledge" - too vague
- "WHY reasoning" - ambiguous (common-sense vs theory)
- "Educational theories" - what level of explicitness?

**Solution - Make it EXPLICIT:**
```
Explanation = Observed Event + Theory Name + Connection

Examples of SUFFICIENT theory mention:
- "According to cognitivism" ‚úì
- "Based on constructivist theory" ‚úì
- "Using scaffolding principles" ‚úì
- "Per self-determination theory" ‚úì

NOT sufficient:
- "gives students room to think" (no theory named)
- "helps learning processes" (too generic)
- "promotes understanding" (no theory)
```

---

### 3. Add "Observed Event" Requirement Everywhere

**R2's pattern:** Theory statements without observed events ‚Üí Others

**Example:**
```
"Constructive feedback supports learning" 
‚Üí R2: Others (generic statement)

"The teacher's constructive feedback on this task supports learning per feedback research"
‚Üí R2: Explanation (connects observed event + theory)
```

**Add to ALL prompts:**
```
CRITICAL: Must reference a SPECIFIC OBSERVED EVENT from the video.

Generic theoretical statements without observed events = "0"
```

---

## üìä Recommended Prompt Modifications (Based on R2)

### Description Prompt (R2-Style)

```
Code as "1" ONLY when describing:
- Specific teaching ACTIONS from the video ("teacher asks question")
- Specific learning BEHAVIORS from the video ("students raise hands")  
- Observable instructional events

Code as "0":
- Demographics ("teacher is experienced", "25 students")
- Setup without action ("articles on board", "classroom arrangement")
- Generic statements ("this is math class")
- Theoretical discourse without observed event
- **CRITICAL:** If not a specific observed teaching/learning action from the video ‚Üí "0"
```

---

### Explanation Prompt (R2-Style) - MAJOR CHANGE

```
Code as "1" when ALL THREE present:
1. **Specific observed event from the video mentioned**
2. **Educational theory/research explicitly named:**
   - Cognitive load theory, Constructivism, SDT, Scaffolding, etc.
   - Or researcher name (Vygotsky, Bloom, Deci & Ryan)
   - Or pedagogical principle (wait time, ZPD, etc.)
3. **Clear CONNECTION** between the observed event and the theory

Code as "0":
- Purpose statements without theory ("to practice conjugation")
- Common-sense reasoning ("repetition helps memory")
- Generic theory discourse not tied to observed event
- Theory mentioned but not APPLIED to specific video event
- **CRITICAL:** Generic theoretical statements about teaching in general (not about the specific video) = "0"

Examples "1":
‚úì "Teacher's wait time (observed) aligns with Rowe's research on thinking time"
‚úì "The scaffolding approach (observed) follows Vygotsky's ZPD principle"
‚úì "This repetition (observed) supports memory per spacing effect research"

Examples "0":
‚úó "Repetition helps students remember" (no theory named)
‚úó "Constructive feedback supports learning" (generic, no observed event)
‚úó "The teacher uses good methods to activate knowledge" (no specific theory)
‚úó "This follows good pedagogical practice" (too vague)
```

---

### Prediction Prompt (R2-Style)

```
Code as "1" when BOTH present:
1. **Specific consequence for STUDENT LEARNING predicted**
   - Learning: understanding, retention, skill development
   - Motivation: engagement, interest, persistence  
   - Affect: confidence, self-efficacy (if learning-related)

2. **Connected to observed teaching event from the video**

Code as "0":
- Teacher-focused outcomes ("teacher will be satisfied")
- Generic outcomes ("class will be better")
- Emotional states without learning connection ("students will be happy")
- Theoretical discourse without prediction of specific video's impact
- **CRITICAL:** Must predict outcome OF THE OBSERVED EVENT, not generic predictions

Examples "1":
‚úì "Teacher's impatience (observed) could decrease student motivation"
‚úì "This feedback approach (observed) might reduce student confidence"
‚úì "Students may better retain conjugations due to this role-play (observed)"

Examples "0":
‚úó "Constructive feedback generally increases motivation" (not about this video)
‚úó "Students will be happy" (emotion, not learning)
‚úó "This is good for learning" (too generic)
```

## ‚úÖ Summary: What I Learned from ACTUAL Human Coding

### Before Looking at Data:
I assumed human coders had good agreement and clear rules.

### After Examining Raw Data:
1. **Initial agreement was TERRIBLE** (Œ∫ near 0 or negative!)
2. **Even after calibration, Explanation Œ∫=0.257** (still problematic)
3. **R2 (best coder) is much STRICTER than our current prompts**
4. **R2 requires:**
   - Observed event connection
   - Explicit theory naming
   - Clear application, not just mention
   - Conservative use of "Others"

### For AI Prompts:
**Follow R2's stricter approach** ‚Üí Better reliability and validity

**Key changes needed:**
1. Require observed event for ALL components
2. Require explicit theory NAMES for Explanation
3. Generic theory discourse ‚Üí Others
4. Common-sense reasoning ‚Üí NOT Explanation

---

## üéØ Next Step

Create **R2-aligned prompts** and test on the same Coding_S2 data to see if AI can match R2's coding better than R1's.

**Hypothesis:** Stricter prompts matching R2's style will:
- Reduce PV overestimation
- Better identify "Others" content
- Have higher Œ∫ with R2's gold standard

This analysis is based on ACTUAL human coding data, not summaries! üî¨
