# Prompt Analysis: Human Coding vs AI Classification
## Comprehensive Review and Recommendations

---

## üîç Key Findings from Human Coding Research

### Inter-Coder Reliability (Cohen's Kappa)

| Component | Kappa Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Description** | 0.63-0.75 | **Substantial** - Humans mostly agree |
| **Explanation** | 0.36-0.48 | **Fair to Moderate** - Significant disagreement |
| **Prediction** | 0.51 | **Moderate** - Some disagreement |
| **Others** | 0.16 | **Poor** - Major disagreement |

**Critical Insight:** Explanation has the LOWEST reliability among PV components, indicating the definition itself is unclear or too subjective.

---

## üéØ Current Prompt Issues

### Issue 1: TOO INCLUSIVE for Explanation

**Current Prompt (Relaxed Version):**
```
Be INCLUSIVE - Accept these as explanations:
* Simple cause-effect statements about classroom dynamics
* Common-sense pedagogical reasoning without technical terms
* Basic explanations of learning processes
* When uncertain, lean toward inclusion (code as "1")
```

**Problem:** This leads to **MASSIVE overestimation**
- Classifies common-sense reasoning as Explanation
- Doesn't require educational theory connection
- "Unclear instructions confused students" ‚Üí Coded as Explanation (should be Description or Others)

### Issue 2: Cannot Identify "Others" Content

**Research Finding:**
- Human coders: **89.1% of segments are "Others"**
- AI prompts: Often classify as 0% or very low Others
- **Result:** 60-100% overestimation of PV scores

**Examples Misclassified:**
```
"The teacher is male and middle-aged" ‚Üí AI: Description (should be: Others)
"The classroom is noisy" ‚Üí AI: Description (should be: Others)  
"Two newspaper articles hang on the board" ‚Üí AI: Description (should be: Others)
```

### Issue 3: Weak Boundary Between Description and Explanation

**Ambiguous cases:**
```
"The teacher's open questions give students room for their own thoughts"
‚Üí Human: Could be Description OR Explanation
‚Üí Current prompt: Explanation (because it mentions WHY - "give room")
‚Üí Problem: This is common-sense, not educational theory
```

## üìã Comparison: Current Prompts vs Human Coding Rules

### Description

| Aspect | Current AI Prompt | Human Coding Practice |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Core** | Observable teaching events | Observable events without evaluation |
| **Strictness** | Moderate | **STRICTER** - must be neutral observation |
| **Examples** | "The teacher explains" | "The teacher writes on board" |
| **Exclusions** | Evaluations, interpretations | Same + speculations |
| **Issue** | ‚ùå Classifies setup/demographics as Description | ‚úÖ Humans code these as Others |

**Recommendation:** **STRICTER** - Add explicit exclusion of:
- Classroom physical descriptions
- Teacher/student demographics  
- Non-teaching related observations

### Explanation

| Aspect | Current AI Prompt | Human Coding Practice |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Core** | Connect events to theories | Connect to educational theories |
| **Strictness** | **TOO LOOSE** | **STRICTER** required |
| **Theory requirement** | "Educational knowledge" (vague) | **Must reference learning theories** |
| **Common-sense** | ‚úÖ Accepted ("give students room") | ‚ùå Not sufficient |
| **Issue** | ‚ùå "Be INCLUSIVE" instruction | ‚úÖ Requires explicit theory connection |

**Recommendation:** **MUCH STRICTER** - Require:
- Explicit mention of educational theories/research
- Clear connection to pedagogical principles
- NOT just common-sense reasoning

### Prediction

| Aspect | Current AI Prompt | Human Coding Practice |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Core** | Effects on student learning | Consequences for students |
| **Strictness** | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Basis requirement** | "Based on learning theories" | **Explicitly theory-based** |
| **Issue** | ‚ùå Accepts speculation without theory | ‚úÖ Requires learning theory connection |

**Recommendation:** **STRICTER** - Emphasize:
- Must be grounded in learning theory
- Not just speculation or guessing
- Clear consequence for student learning

## üî¨ Concrete Examples: What Should Change

### Example 1: Common-Sense Reasoning

**Text:** "The unclear instructions confused the students"

| Current Classification | Should Be | Reasoning |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Explanation** (WHY reasoning) | **Description** or **Others** | No educational theory cited, just common sense |

**Fix:** Require explicit theory connection for Explanation.

---

### Example 2: Observable Event

**Text:** "The teacher writes the topic on the board"

| Current Classification | Should Be | Reasoning |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Description** | **Description** ‚úì | Correct - observable teaching event |

**No change needed** - this is correct.

---

### Example 3: Pedagogical Reasoning with Theory

**Text:** "Through repetition, students can better remember the conjugations according to cognitive load theory"

| Current Classification | Should Be | Reasoning |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Explanation** | **Explanation** ‚úì | Correct - explicit theory connection |

**No change needed** - this is correct.

---

### Example 4: Setup/Demographics

**Text:** "The classroom has 25 students and is well-lit"

| Current Classification | Should Be | Reasoning |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Description** | **Others** | Not a teaching/learning event |

**Fix:** Explicitly exclude physical descriptions, demographics from Description.

---

### Example 5: Speculation without Theory

**Text:** "This approach will likely increase student motivation"

| Current Classification | Should Be | Reasoning |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Prediction** | **Others** or **Prediction with caveat** | Says "likely" but no theory cited |

**Fix:** Require theory basis, not just speculation.

---

## üéØ Recommended Prompt Modifications

### 1. Description Prompt - ADD STRICTER EXCLUSIONS

**Current:**
```
CRITERIA FOR "0":
- Contains evaluations
- Contains interpretations  
- Contains speculations
- Not about teaching/learning events
```

**Recommended - ADD:**
```
STRICT EXCLUSIONS (Code as "0"):
- Classroom physical setup ("well-lit classroom", "desks in rows")
- Teacher/student demographics ("25 students", "teacher is experienced")
- Non-teaching context ("This is a math class", "School is in Munich")
- Equipment/materials without teaching action ("Worksheets on desk", "Smartboard available")
- Student appearance without learning behavior ("Students wear uniforms", "Student looks tired")

ONLY Code as "1" when:
- Specific TEACHING actions observed ("teacher asks questions", "gives feedback")
- Specific LEARNING behaviors observed ("students raise hands", "students discuss in pairs")
- Observable instructional events ("teacher writes on board DURING explanation")
```

---

### 2. Explanation Prompt - REQUIRE THEORY (MUCH STRICTER)

**Current (TOO LOOSE):**
```
Be INCLUSIVE - Accept these as explanations:
* Simple cause-effect statements
* Common-sense pedagogical reasoning
* When uncertain, lean toward inclusion
```

**Recommended - STRICT THEORY REQUIREMENT:**
```
STRICT CRITERIA FOR "1" (Explanation):
Requires ALL THREE elements:
1. Observable teaching/learning event mentioned
2. WHY reasoning provided
3. **EXPLICIT connection to educational theory, research, or pedagogical principle**

Accepted theoretical frameworks:
- Cognitive load theory
- Constructivism
- Self-determination theory
- Scaffolding principles
- Wait time research
- Bloom's taxonomy
- Zone of proximal development
- Active learning research

Examples that COUNT as "1":
* "Open questions activate prior knowledge according to constructivist theory"
* "Wait time increases thinking based on research (Rowe, 1986)"
* "Scaffolding helps students reach their ZPD per Vygotsky"
* "This aligns with cognitive load theory principles"

Examples that DON'T count as "1" (Common-sense reasoning):
* "Open questions give students room to think" (NO theory cited)
* "Repetition helps memory" (NO specific theory cited)
* "Unclear instructions confused students" (NO theory - just obvious cause-effect)
* "Students engaged because activity was hands-on" (NO theory framework)

Code as "0" when:
* Only common-sense reasoning without theory
* No explicit theory/research mentioned
* General pedagogical language without specific framework
* WHY reasoning present BUT no theoretical grounding
```

---

### 3. Prediction Prompt - REQUIRE THEORY BASIS

**Current:**
```
CRITERIA FOR "1":
- Predicts effects on student learning
- Based on educational knowledge
- Focuses on consequences for students
```

**Recommended - ADD THEORY REQUIREMENT:**
```
STRICT CRITERIA FOR "1" (Prediction):
Requires BOTH:
1. Predicts specific effect on student learning/motivation/understanding
2. **Grounded in learning theory or research** (not just speculation)

Examples that COUNT as "1":
* "This feedback could increase motivation per self-determination theory"
* "Students may develop deeper understanding through constructive alignment"
* "Based on retrieval practice research, this will aid retention"
* "Cognitive load theory suggests this may overwhelm students"

Examples that DON'T count (Speculation without theory):
* "This will likely increase motivation" (NO theory - just guess)
* "Students may feel confused" (Possible, but no learning theory basis)
* "This could improve understanding" (NO specific theory cited)
* "Students will probably enjoy this" (Enjoyment ‚â† learning outcome)

Code as "0" when:
* Pure speculation without theory
* Emotional predictions without learning basis ("feel happy")
* General outcome guesses ("will be better")
* No connection to learning theories
```

## üîç Edge Cases: Human Coder Disagreements

### Case 1: "Teacher asks open questions to activate prior knowledge"

| Coder | Classification | Reasoning |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **R1** | Explanation | "activate prior knowledge" suggests constructivism |
| **R2** | Description | Just describes what teacher did, "activate" could be intent not theory |
| **R3** | Explanation | Mentions pedagogical purpose |
| **Current AI** | Explanation | Sees WHY reasoning |

**Resolution:** With STRICTER prompt:
- Code as "1" (Explanation) ONLY if explicitly states: "activate prior knowledge **according to constructivist theory**"
- Code as "0" without explicit theory mention
- **Why:** "Activate prior knowledge" is education jargon but not necessarily theory application

---

### Case 2: "Students work in pairs because collaboration improves learning"

| Coder | Classification | Reasoning |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **R1** | Explanation | States WHY (collaboration) |
| **R2** | Description | Generic statement, no specific theory |
| **R4** | Others | Too vague, no real theory |
| **Current AI** | Explanation | Sees cause-effect |

**Resolution:** With STRICTER prompt:
- Code as "1" ONLY if: "Students work in pairs based on **cooperative learning research** (Johnson & Johnson)" or "per **social constructivism**"
- Code as "0" for "collaboration improves learning" alone (too generic)

---

### Case 3: "The negative feedback could discourage participation"

| Coder | Classification | Reasoning |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **R1** | Prediction | Predicts student response |
| **R2** | Explanation | Explains effect of feedback |
| **R3** | Prediction | Future consequence |
| **Current AI** | Prediction or Explanation | Ambiguous |

**Resolution:** With STRICTER prompt:
- Code as "1" (Prediction) if: "could discourage participation **per self-determination theory**" or "**based on motivation research**"
- Code as "1" (Explanation) if: "The negative feedback discouraged participation **because it threatened autonomy (SDT)**"
- Code as "0" without theory - just speculation

---

## üìä Proposed New Prompts (STRICTER VERSION)

### Description - STRICTER

```
You are an expert in analyzing teaching reflections. Determine if this text contains NEUTRAL DESCRIPTIONS of observable teaching or learning events.

DEFINITION: Descriptions identify specific, observable teaching or learning actions WITHOUT interpretation, evaluation, or reasoning about WHY/consequences.

STRICT CRITERIA FOR "1":
‚úì Specific teacher instructional action ("asks question", "writes on board", "gives feedback")
‚úì Specific student learning behavior ("raises hand", "works on worksheet", "discusses in pairs")
‚úì Observable classroom interaction ("teacher calls on student", "students present solutions")
‚úì NEUTRAL language - no "because", "should", "will", "likely"

STRICT CRITERIA FOR "0":
‚úó Classroom physical setup ("desks in rows", "well-lit room")
‚úó Demographics ("25 students", "experienced teacher", "5th grade class")
‚úó Non-teaching context ("This is math class", "Video from Germany")
‚úó Materials/equipment alone ("Worksheets available", "Smartboard present")
‚úó Appearance ("students look tired", "teacher wears glasses")
‚úó ANY reasoning about WHY or consequences
‚úó Evaluations ("good question", "effective method")
‚úó Interpretations ("This activates...", "This helps...")
‚úó Speculation ("likely", "probably", "seems to")

CRITICAL: Only observable TEACHING/LEARNING ACTIONS, not context or setup!

Examples "1":
* "The teacher asks an open question"
* "Students raise their hands"
* "Teacher writes the topic on the board"
* "Students work in small groups"
* "Teacher provides individual feedback to students"

Examples "0":
* "The classroom has 25 students" (demographics)
* "Worksheets are on the desks" (materials alone)
* "This is a physics lesson" (context)
* "The teacher seems experienced" (evaluation)
* "Students appear engaged" (interpretation)

TEXT: {text}
```

### Explanation - MUCH STRICTER (Require Theory)

```
You are an expert in analyzing teaching reflections. Determine if this text EXPLICITLY connects teaching events to EDUCATIONAL THEORIES or RESEARCH.

DEFINITION: Explanations relate observable teaching events to established educational theories, learning science, or pedagogical research. Must explain WHY using theoretical frameworks.

STRICT CRITERIA FOR "1" - Requires ALL:
‚úì Observable teaching/learning event mentioned
‚úì WHY reasoning provided  
‚úì **EXPLICIT mention of educational theory, research, or pedagogical principle**

Accepted theoretical references (examples):
* "Cognitive load theory"
* "Constructivism" / "Constructivist approach"
* "Self-determination theory" / "Motivation theory"  
* "Scaffolding" (Vygotsky)
* "Zone of proximal development" / "ZPD"
* "Wait time research" / "Think time (Rowe)"
* "Bloom's taxonomy"
* "Active learning principles"
* "Retrieval practice" / "Spacing effect"
* Specific researcher names (Piaget, Vygotsky, Deci & Ryan, etc.)

STRICT CRITERIA FOR "0" - Common-sense reasoning WITHOUT theory:
‚úó "Open questions give students room to think" (No theory - common sense)
‚úó "Repetition helps memory" (No specific theory cited)
‚úó "Unclear instructions confused students" (Obvious cause-effect, no theory)
‚úó "Students engaged because activity was hands-on" (No theory framework)
‚úó "Teacher uses pairs to promote collaboration" (No theory basis stated)
‚úó "Feedback helps students improve" (Generic, no theory)
‚úó Any WHY reasoning without explicit theory mention

Examples "1" (EXPLICIT theory required):
* "Open questions activate prior knowledge according to constructivist theory"
* "Wait time increases student thinking as shown by Rowe's research"
* "This scaffolding approach aligns with Vygotsky's ZPD concept"
* "Per cognitive load theory, this reduces extraneous load"
* "Self-determination theory suggests this supports autonomy"

Examples "0" (No theory = not explanation):
* "Open questions make students think more" (No theory)
* "Hands-on activities increase engagement" (No theory)
* "Clear instructions reduce confusion" (Obvious, no theory)
* "Group work promotes collaboration" (No theory cited)
* "Positive feedback motivates students" (Common sense, no SDT reference)

CRITICAL: If NO educational theory/research explicitly mentioned ‚Üí Code as "0"

TEXT: {text}
```

---

### Prediction - STRICTER (Require Theory)

```
You are an expert in analyzing teaching reflections. Determine if this text contains THEORY-BASED predictions about effects on student learning.

DEFINITION: Predictions estimate specific consequences of teaching events for student learning, motivation, or understanding, GROUNDED in learning theories.

STRICT CRITERIA FOR "1" - Requires BOTH:
‚úì Specific predicted effect on students (learning/motivation/understanding)
‚úì **Grounded in educational theory or research** (not just speculation)

Learning outcome predictions (if theory-based):
* Deep understanding / Surface learning
* Motivation / Engagement / Interest
* Retention / Memory / Recall
* Transfer of knowledge
* Cognitive development
* Self-efficacy / Confidence

STRICT CRITERIA FOR "0":
‚úó Speculation without theory ("will likely", "may possibly")
‚úó Emotional predictions alone ("feel happy", "get frustrated") without learning connection
‚úó General outcome guesses ("will be better", "could improve")
‚úó Predictions about teacher behavior (not student learning)
‚úó No grounding in learning theory or research

Examples "1" (Theory-based prediction):
* "This feedback could increase intrinsic motivation per self-determination theory"
* "Students may develop deeper understanding through constructivist learning"
* "Based on retrieval practice research, this will improve long-term retention"
* "Cognitive load theory suggests students may experience overwhelm"
* "This scaffolding should support learning in their ZPD (Vygotsky)"

Examples "0" (Speculation without theory):
* "This will likely increase motivation" (No SDT reference)
* "Students may feel confused" (Emotion, not learning outcome)
* "This could help them understand better" (Generic, no theory)
* "They will probably enjoy this activity" (Enjoyment ‚â† learning)
* "Students might remember this longer" (No retrieval practice reference)

CRITICAL: Prediction about learning + Theory basis = "1"; Speculation alone = "0"

## üìä Expected Impact of STRICTER Prompts

### Current (Loose) Results:
```
"blah blah" input:
‚Üí D: 0%, E: 0%, P: 0% (correctly identifies non-PV)
‚Üí But: Generic text often gets 60-90% PV (overestimation)
```

### With STRICTER Prompts:
```
Generic/Common-sense reflection:
‚Üí D: 40%, E: 5%, P: 5% (much lower E and P)
‚Üí Others: 50% (correctly identifies non-PV content)

Theory-rich reflection:
‚Üí D: 50%, E: 30%, P: 20%  
‚Üí More accurate representation
```

## üéØ Recommendation Summary

| Component | Current Approach | Recommended Change | Priority |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Description** | Moderate | **Add strict exclusions** (demographics, setup) | Medium |
| **Explanation** | Too loose | **REQUIRE explicit theory** - biggest change | **HIGH** |
| **Prediction** | Moderate-loose | **Require theory grounding** | Medium |

---

## üìù Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: STRICTER Explanation Prompt (Highest Priority)
**Why first:** Lowest human reliability, biggest overestimation issue
**Change:** Remove "Be INCLUSIVE", add "Require explicit theory mention"
**Test:** Run on 50 samples, compare with human R2 coding
**Expected:** E% drops significantly, better matches human coding

### Phase 2: Refine Description Exclusions
**Why:** Reduce false positives on "Others" content
**Change:** Add explicit exclusion list for non-teaching descriptions
**Test:** Check if "Others" detection improves
**Expected:** Better identification of non-PV content

### Phase 3: Stricter Prediction Requirements
**Why:** Reduce speculation without theory
**Change:** Emphasize theory grounding
**Test:** Compare predictions with/without theory mentions
**Expected:** More conservative prediction coding

---

## üî¨ Validation Approach

### Step 1: Create Test Set
- Use 100 segments from human coding (mix of D, E, P, Others)
- Include edge cases where human coders disagreed
- Cover full range: pure description, theory-rich, common-sense, non-PV

### Step 2: Test STRICTER Prompts
- Run new prompts on test set
- Compare with human R2 (best coder)
- Calculate Cohen's kappa
- Target: Œ∫ > 0.60 for each component

### Step 3: Analyze Disagreements
- Cases where AI="1" but Human="0" ‚Üí Too loose still
- Cases where AI="0" but Human="1" ‚Üí Too strict
- Iterate until balanced

### Step 4: A/B Test with Students
- Half get current (loose) prompts
- Half get new (strict) prompts
- Compare:
  - PV score distributions
  - Student perceptions
  - Feedback quality
  - Revision patterns

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-offs to Consider

### Stricter Prompts:

**Pros:**
‚úÖ Better matches human coding
‚úÖ Reduces overestimation
‚úÖ More accurate Others detection
‚úÖ Higher inter-rater reliability with humans
‚úÖ Forces students to use theory explicitly

**Cons:**
‚ùå May discourage students (lower scores)
‚ùå Could miss implicit theory knowledge
‚ùå Requires students to know theory names
‚ùå May penalize non-native speakers
‚ùå Less formative (more summative)

### Current Loose Prompts:

**Pros:**
‚úÖ Encouraging for students (higher scores)
‚úÖ Recognizes implicit understanding
‚úÖ More formative feedback
‚úÖ Accessible to beginners
‚úÖ Rewards effort even without theory names

**Cons:**
‚ùå Overestimates PV significantly
‚ùå Poor alignment with expert judgment
‚ùå Inflates scores artificially
‚ùå Doesn't push students to use theory
‚ùå Research validity concerns

---

## üí° My Recommendation

### **Use STRICTER Prompts for Explanation**

**Reasoning:**
1. Explanation has **lowest human reliability** (Œ∫=0.36-0.48)
2. Current "Be INCLUSIVE" instruction is the **root cause**
3. **Biggest impact** on reducing overestimation
4. **Educational benefit:** Pushes students to learn and use theory names
5. **Research validity:** Better alignment with expert coding

### **Keep Moderate for Description and Prediction**

**Reasoning:**
1. Description already has good reliability (Œ∫=0.63-0.75)
2. Too strict might discourage students unnecessarily
3. Balance research validity with formative support

---

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Implement STRICTER Explanation prompt** in test environment
2. **Run validation study** on 100 samples (compare with human R2)
3. **Calculate new inter-rater reliability** (AI vs Human)
4. **If Œ∫ > 0.60:** Deploy to production
5. **If Œ∫ < 0.60:** Iterate on prompt wording
6. **Monitor student reactions** after deployment
7. **Compare PV distributions** before/after prompt change

---

## üéì Conclusion

**The current "relaxed" Explanation prompt is TOO LOOSE** and causes:
- Low inter-rater reliability with humans
- Massive PV overestimation
- Accepts common-sense as theory application

**Recommendation: Shift to STRICTER, theory-requiring prompts**, especially for Explanation.

**Trade-off:** May lower student scores but improves research validity and pushes better learning.

**Decision point:** Formative support vs Research accuracy - You must choose based on your study goals.
